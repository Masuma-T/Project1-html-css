      <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="center-text">
        <p>At Jiffy Listing, we specialize in real estate photography tailored to the vibrant and competitive Edmonton market. 
            We believe every property has a story—and our mission is to help that story shine through compelling visuals that leave a 
            lasting impression.</p>
        <p> To achieve this goal, we use high-quality equipment and techniques to capture the property from a variety of angles and lighting
            conditions. We also pay close attention to composition and framing to create visually appealing images.</p>
        <p>By working together, we can create a set of images that accurately and effectively represent the property and make it stand out 
            on the real estate market.</p> </div>

      <h3>Exterior Photography</h3>
      <p>High-quality exterior photographs can help to showcase the property's curb appeal and give potential buyers a first impression of the property. These images also highlight unique features like architecture, landscaping, and outdoor spaces.</p>
      <p>They also give buyers a sense of the property's location and surroundings—especially valuable for homes in attractive neighborhoods.</p>

      <h3>Interior Photography</h3>

      <h3>Matterport Virtual Tours</h3>
      <p>Matterport virtual tours allow potential buyers to explore properties remotely with an immersive 3D walkthrough experience.</p>
      <p>These tours are convenient, time-saving, and offer buyers full control over how and when they explore, especially during times when in-person viewings are limited.</p>
      <p>Sellers also benefit by reaching a broader audience and shortening the selling cycle.</p>

    <div class="about-box">
      <h3>Floor Plans</h3>
      <p>Detailed floor plans help buyers understand a property's flow and layout before stepping foot inside. This increases confidence in the listing and helps it stand out.</p>
      <p>Including a floor plan is a proven way to increase listing effectiveness and attract more qualified buyers.</p>
